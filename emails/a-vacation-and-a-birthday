Hello, everyone! I forgot to mention that my wife Jaimie and I are on vacation, celebrating 10 years of marriage, June 1–12 (including my birthday today!), so no email (other than this one!) for this last weekend or the one upcoming. I’ll be back at it, and quite re-energized if the first few days here in Jamaica are any guide, for the June 15 issue!
