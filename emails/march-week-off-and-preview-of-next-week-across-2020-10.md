Hello readers,

Been a strange week, so this is my once-a-month week off. I’ll be back next week, likely with some reflections from Elizabeth Eisenstein’s <cite>The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</cite>. I told a friend this week that Eisenstein’s book has become my relaxing reading. Given it’s an 800-page *tome* on a massive cultural event, well, you now have further evidence of just what kind of a nerd I am. It sure beats Kurzweil’s <cite>The Age of Spiritual Machines</cite>, though, which I’m laboring through for [Winning Slowly] and will be glad to be done with.

See you in a week!
