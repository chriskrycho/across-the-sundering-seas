Hello, readers!

This is my monthly week off of writing the newsletter. With the *slight* relaxation of stay-at-home guidelines in Colorado this past week, we had a small family get-together to celebrate Mother’s Day (a week early), and that took much of my day. The remainder of it is apt to be spent in a mix of working on some composing, some photo editing, and perhaps—perhaps!—working on a right and proper essay. See you next Saturday, most likely with a bunch of leftover materials from the essay I’m building this week!
