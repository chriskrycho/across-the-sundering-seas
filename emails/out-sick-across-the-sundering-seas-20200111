Hello readers—just a quick note that this is an out-sick kind of week for the newsletter. I ended up with a nasty chest cold and my dear wife got a kidney infection of all things; the net is that I didn’t have the requisite mental or physical bandwidth to write! Since I've committed to publishing this weekly, I wanted to let you know that I have not, in fact, fallen off the bandwagon *immediately after starting*. I’ll be back next Saturday… and I have books coming this week! So many books! I’ve no doubt I’ll have a *lot* to say.

(If you’re trying to remember what this even is: I’m [Chris Krycho], and this is [Across the Sundering Seas][newsletter], a weekly email, reflecting publicly on my reading and research on everything from theology to open source software licenses. You can always [unsubscribe] if you’re dying of newsletter overload or just because I’m way too wordy. For those of who you’ve read any of this, and doubly to those of you who keep reading: *thank you!*)

See you in a week when I’m less sick!
