Dear readers—

—today I realized that mechanically, this needs to be a (number of weeks in the month − 1)-issues-per-month newsletter. This week involved (a) publishing a [new Winning Slowly episode](https://winningslowly.org/8.03/), (b) recording two *more* episodes, (c) participating in training for a lay pastoral role in my church, (d) many family goings-on, (e) filing my taxes, (f) spending time with good friends for the first time in almost a month [!], and *therefore* (g) almost no reading at all.

That all being the case, *this* week that’s all I have on offer. I’m updating the website accordingly to set expectations clearly. And then, rather amusingly, I’m going to go read one of the books on which I normally would have commented in this issue! I’ll be back *next* week with the usual.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for understanding as I find the balance that works well for me with this newsletter amidst my other responsibilities!
