Hey readers,

[Chris] here, noting that this week will be my week off for April. I mentioned last week that my wife had been sick; it was indeed COVID as far as we can tell (as some of you might have surmised from last week’s email). I say “as far as we can tell” because Colorado is reserving tests for pregnant women, the elderly, and the immunocompromised: none of which my wife is—but the symptoms fit the bill to a ‘T’. We’re grateful that it was a *relatively* mild case, which she got through in one piece… by resting nonstop for two full weeks, many of those days sleeping 18–20 hours per day. Gladly, she is on the mend. We’re grateful. There’s a good chance I’ll actually read some books this week!

I hope you’re all staying well. This stuff is scary and dangerous. It has hit families we know, and it probably has for you as well. Grace and peace to all of you in the midst of it.
